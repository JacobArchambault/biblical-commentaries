\chapter{Romans 1:8-17}
\section{Verses 8-17}
Now first, I give grace well to my God by Jesus the anointed concerning all of you, that your faith is announced forth in the whole world. For my witness is God, to whom I serve in my spirit in the good message of his son, that I make your remembrance unceasingly, always upon my prayers setting apart (if by any way some time), that I may be given in God's will to go for you. For I desire to see you, that may give over some spiritual grace to you unto making you firm - which is, however, to be strengthened together among you, by faith, both yours and mine, among each other. But I do not wish you to not know, brothers, that I have often set forth to go for you -  and I am barred even now - that some fruit I might have, too, among you, just as also in the other nations. For  to both Greeks and barbarians, wise and ignorant I am indebted, such that after me is urged forth to announce well to you also in Rome. For I do not blush at the good message. for the power of God is unto healing to each believing, both Jew first and Greek. For God's justness in him is unhidden, from faith unto faith, just as it is written, the just one shall live from faith.
